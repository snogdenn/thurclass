Discharge Disposition: Extended Care  Facility: [**Hospital3 672**] Hospital  Discharge Diagnosis: Ventilator associated pneumonia Left lower lobe collapse Acute renal failure likely from ischemic ATN   Discharge Condition: conversant through eye blinking, quadriplegic   Discharge Instructions: Admitted for ventilator associated pneumonia. Treated initially with broad spectrum antibiotics: Vanco, Ceftazidime and Levofloxacin. Subsequently blood cultures positive for Staph coag negative. Antibiotic coverage reduced to Vancomycin alone for 2 week course. Subsequent blood cultures negative. TTE negative. Pt also found to have rising creatinine, likely due to initial hypotension in the context of GPC sepsis. Never on vasopressors, however initially needed fluid resuscitation. Continue to hold Metoprolol for now. [**Month (only) 116**] restart once renal function recovered. Respiratory settings unchanged from baseline. Patient with copious secretions, will need frequent suctioning. Patient will need: -Ventilator treatment, Mouthcare, Chlorhexidine mouthwash -Continue Vancomycin for a 14 day course, first day [**2189-2-14**] -Daily labs to monitor creatinine -Cardiopulmonary assessment, restart Metoprolol once MAP > 65 continously for 2days   Followup Instructions: With physicians at rehab on daily basis                                [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2437**] MD [**MD Number(1) 2438**]  ",386361321
