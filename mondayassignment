#Question 2: Write a one-sentence comment explaining whether you plan to consider the original or log-transferred data and why? 
 #I plan to consider the orginial data because it would follow a normal distribution. This means that it will represent the actual measurements. 
#Question 3: Use t.test to perform Welch's t-test comparing the cholesterol in men and women on either the original or log-transformed data, depending on what you chose
```{r}
chol_men <- heart$chol[heart$sex == 1]

chol_women <- heart$chol[heart$sex == 0]

ttestresult <- t.test(chol_men, chol_women, alternative = "two.sided")
print(ttestresult)
```

#Question 4: Write a one-sentence comment that states the p-value obtained from the t-test and whether it's significant at a significance level of 0.05
  #The p-value of the t-test is 0.002985. This would make it a non significant t-test. 

#Question 5: Write a one-sentence comment that interprets the p-values
  #Because the p-value is 0.002985, that means that there would be a higher chance to reject the null and that means that there is a large difference between cholesterol level averages amongst men and women in this data set.
